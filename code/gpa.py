'''
This program takes a gpa as input and returns one of the following:

    "Invalid GPA" when gpa is outside the 0.0 to 4.0 range
    "Summa Cum Laude" when gpa >= 3.8
    "Magna Cum Laude" when gpa >= 3.6 and gpa < 3.8
    "Cum Laude" when gpa >=3.4 and gpa < 3.6
    "Academic Probation" when gpa <= 1.8
    "Passing" for any other gpa


Please note this program was written incorrectly on purpose. You will learn to use
pytest to identify non-error bugs in your code.
